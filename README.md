# Jot It

Jot It is a note management app that uses markdown to format notes. It is in very early stages of development, so key features are missing.

## Suggestions
For feature requests, please add an issue with the label "enhancement". Thank you for sharing your ideas!

## How to help
If you want to help, feel free to make a PR. Be sure to lint and run tests! I have a loose idea on what I want this app to be, so I'll be sure to review the PR. If for some reason it's not merged in, forks of this project are always welcome!
